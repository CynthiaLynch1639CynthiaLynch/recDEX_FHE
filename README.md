# recDEX_FHE: A Privacy-Focused DEX for Renewable Energy Credits 🌍💚

recDEX_FHE is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed specifically for the trading of tokenized renewable energy credits (RECs). Leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, every transaction made on recDEX_FHE is FHE-encrypted, ensuring that the privacy of businesses' energy strategies and environmentally-friendly actions remains intact. This innovative exchange aims to reshape the renewable energy market by providing a secure and transparent trading platform.

## The Challenge: A Fragmented Market

The renewable energy market, while essential for sustainable growth, often suffers from issues such as lack of transparency, inefficient trading processes, and privacy concerns. Businesses and individuals are reluctant to engage in trading RECs due to fears of exposing sensitive information related to their energy credits, which could lead to competitive disadvantages or regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, existing platforms tend to lack the necessary infrastructure to facilitate efficient and private trading of these crucial assets.

## How FHE Changes the Game

With **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, recDEX_FHE offers a groundbreaking solution to the aforementioned problems. FHE allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing access to the underlying information. By utilizing **Concrete**, Zama's open-source libraries, the recDEX_FHE platform can facilitate secure transactions, ensuring that businesses can trade RECs with full confidence that their data remains private. This not only enhances trust among participants but also helps to promote an efficient market for renewable energy.

## Core Functionalities That Empower Users

recDEX_FHE puts a range of powerful features at your fingertips, including:

- **FHE-Encrypted Transactions**: All trades on recDEX_FHE are encrypted, safeguarding the privacy of users' trading strategies.
- **Global REC Trading Facility**: A comprehensive platform that allows users to buy and sell RECs globally.
- **Transparent Infrastructure**: Built to ensure traceability while maintaining confidentiality, fostering an environment of trust.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface that makes browsing and trading REC assets straightforward and efficient.
- **Cross-Functional Integration**: Connects with various renewable energy sources, making it easy for users to access diverse asset types.

## Technology Stack: Building the Future

The backbone of recDEX_FHE consists of several cutting-edge technologies, with a focus on confidentiality and security. Here’s what powers our platform:

- **Zama's FHE SDK**: The primary component used for confidential computing.
- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **Node.js**: For backend services.
- **Hardhat**: For development and testing of Ethereum smart contracts.

## Directory Structure

Here’s an overview of the project structure for recDEX_FHE:

```
recDEX_FHE/
├── contracts/
│   └── recDEX_FHE.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── test/
│   └── recDEX_FHE.test.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Getting Started: Installation Guide

To set up recDEX_FHE, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project files**: Ensure you have the project files available locally.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to install required packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

   This will fetch the necessary Zama FHE libraries and other dependencies for running the DEX.

3. **Ensure Node.js and Hardhat are installed**: Make sure you have Node.js and Hardhat installed on your machine.

## Building & Running the Exchange

To compile the smart contracts and run tests, use the following commands:

1. **Compile the Contracts**:
   
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy to a Network**:
   
   After compiling, you can deploy the smart contracts using:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

Once deployed, you can interact with the DEX directly through the user interface or through scripts to automate trading processes. 

## Example of Using the DEX

Here’s a simple example of how to trade REC tokens on the recDEX_FHE platform:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const recDEX = await ethers.getContractAt("recDEX_FHE", "your_contract_address");
    const tx = await recDEX.tradeREC(recipientAddress, amountIn, { gasLimit: 500000 });
    await tx.wait();
    console.log("Trade executed successfully!");
}

main().catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

This code shows how to execute a trade using the DEX. Ensure you replace `recipientAddress` and `amountIn` with the appropriate values.
